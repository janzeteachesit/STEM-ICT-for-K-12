## Sub-title

### Description
Goal:  Model, design, build, and test a re-useable compressed air rocket that will fly as far and accurately as possible. 

Learn how to use spreadsheets and practice the principle of controlled experimentation to design the best possible rocket.

### What are the parameters of a compressed air rocket?

A "parameter" is some feature of a system that you can measure. For example, in a swing set, one parameter (design choice) is LENGTH of the chain or rope. What parameters do you think matter when you are designing a rocket, or measuring it's performance? For each parameter you come up with, give the units you would use to measure it. For example, MASS (kg) [26 Returned](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/NDI1NTM0MDAyOTFa/sa/NDI5NDI1OTM0NjFa/submissions/by-status/and-sort-name/returned) 

### Getting started with spreadsheets

submit the link to your groups spreadsheet, showing calculations for rectangle, triangle, square and circle.

### First Rocket Launch (Video Submission)

Every group member should submit a video of their first rocket launches. We will be using these for later analysis! [Returned](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/NDI1NTM0MDAyOTFa/a/NDQxNjU4MjU4NjRa/submissions/by-status/and-sort-name/returned)

### Rocket Plan

The purpose of this assignment is to create a plan for next week's launches. This is the best route to optimizing the performance of your rocket. As a group there are three things to do, and two things to submit:

1. Build or design a prototype (your best guess of what will work well)

2. Create and submit a diagram (to this post) that shows the length, shape, fins, etc. so that you could rebuild the rocket exactly the same, if you needed to.

3. Pick a parameter (for example: angle of launch, mass of rocket, number of fins) that you will explore next week and submit what range of values you will try as a comment. If you are doing launch angle, for example, you might try 10, 20, 30, ... , 80 degrees.

### How to Graph Data in Excel

Here's the spreadsheet we made in class. Some of the highlights from our discussion about data collection and analysis are:

1. It takes a bit of data to start to reveal a trend or pattern. Gather as much data as you can.

2. The values are not exactly. All measurement has some uncertainty.

3. The best graphs give you a pattern that shows a relationship between two parameters. For example, we can conclude "changing the launch angle affects the range. It looks like a "middle angle" gives a better distance than very low, or very high angle."

### Rocket Report

Use the following template and your graphs to develop a report, as a group, that gives advice on how to create a great compressed air rocket.

Assume that your audience is next year's STEM 8, and let them know what you found out and how you did it.

### Rocket Distance Challenge

These are the results from our final launches on Thursday.

1 = successful launch

2 = 15 m or more

3 = 50 m or more

4 = 75 m or more

Nice work, all! [Graded](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/NDI1NTM0MDAyOTFa/a/NDYxMDQ1OTA1NzFa/submissions/by-status/and-sort-name/returned)**
