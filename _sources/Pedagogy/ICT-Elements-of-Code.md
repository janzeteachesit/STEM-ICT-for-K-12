- In the attached PowerPoint, use screen captures of parts of the code you used for the \[Previous / Related Assignment] to demonstrate how you APPLIED the following elements of code:
	- Sequence (order matters)
	- Variables (boxes of memory to hold values)
	- Conditionals (questions and choices)
	- Iterations (loops)
	- Functions (mini-programs)

- As well, EXTEND your previous answer to demonstrate the following Computational Thinking practices:
	- Decomposition (what was the problem; what smaller pieces did you break it into?)
	- Pattern Recognition (what parts is the problem made of; what actions repeat?)
	- Abstraction (in what ways did you make one thing that can be used in more than one situation?)
	- Algorithms (what "recipes" did you make; what "problems" did they solve?)
