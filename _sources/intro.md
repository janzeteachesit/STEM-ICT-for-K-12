# Welcome to STEM ICT for K-12 

## What is this book all about

STEM ICT for K-12 is an online book for anyone interested in project-based learning, the new BC ADST curriculum and Information and Communication Technologies.  There are no prerequisites for this material, and no prior knowledge is assumed.

This book is designed originally for grades 5 - 9 educators working within the Vancouver School  Board, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The expectation is that, except for rare cases, much of the information found inside can be adapted with minimal work for both older and younger students.  Later version will directly address these other grades
