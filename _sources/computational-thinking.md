## Computational Thinking is:
> the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are in a form that can be effectively carried out by an information-processing agent.

>Informally, computational thinking describes the mental activity in formulating a problem to admit a computational solution.  The solution can be carried out by a human or a machine or, more generally, by combinations of humans and machines.”

## The “four pillars” of Computational Thinking
### Decomposition
- Breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces: Remembering phone numbers; Reading words; Performing arithmetic operations
-  turn larger puzzles into small puzzles
- "The ability to break down a task {or problem} into minute details so that we can clearly explain a process to another person or to a computer, or even to just write notes for ourselves."
### Pattern Matching (Pattern Recognition)
- Finding similarities between items as a way of gaining information
- find similarities between obstacles
- "The ability to notice similarities or common differences that will help us make predictions or lead us to shortcuts."
### Abstraction (Pattern  Generalization)
- Ignoring certain details in order to come up with a solution that works for a more general problem
- repurpose a previous solution with new details by abstracting out differences
- "The ability to filter out information that is not necessary to solve a certain type of problem and generalize the information that is necessary."
### Automating with Algorithms (Algorithm Design)
- Controlling a process by automatic means, executing tasks using well-defined instructions
- "The ability to develop a step-by-step strategy for solving a problem."
