# Choice Project
## Choice Project Overview

### Research and Project Planning

This part is critical.  There are three assignments to submit.  The research is about avoiding the most common and time-wasting mistakes by learning from those who have gone before you.  The project plan requires that you think your way through the project before actually starting—Is it possible?  Do I have enough time?  Will it cost money or other resources? Is it dangerous? Et cetera.

| Assignment/ To-Hand-In  | End-Of-Day Goal | Due Date |
|---|---|---|
| [Choice Project Topic](ChoiceProjectTopic.md)| Submit your project plan | Wed, June 9, 2021 |
| [Choice Project Plan](Choice-Project-Plan.md) | Explore ideas and commit to a project. | Tue, June 8, 2021 |

### Creating Your Artifact

This is where your research efforts and project plan will pay off. Big hint: things always take longer than you might expect, so plan to get done early so that you have time for when things go wrong (they nearly always do).

| Assignment/ To-Hand-In  | End-Of-Day Goal | Due Date |
|---|---|---|
| [Choice Progress Report](Choice-Progress-Report.md) | Finish your first iteration/stage of the build and see if it works. | Tue, June 15, 2021 |
| [Choice Progress Report & Reflection](Choice-Progress-Report-Reflection.md) | Finish your build and see if it works. | Tue, June 22, 2021 |

### Showcase and Reflection

What have you accomplished?  What do you have to share?  How did it go?

| Assignment/ To-Hand-In  | End-Of-Day Goal | Due Date |
