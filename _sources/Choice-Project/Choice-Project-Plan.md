# Choice Project Plan 

back to [Choice-Project-Overview](Choice-Project-Overview.md)

## Name(s): 

__Introduction__:  More and more we are finding that students have excellent project suggestions that align strongly with their own personal experiences and passions.  The purpose of this document is to provide an opportunity for students to research and draft their own project plan.  Complete and submit this document for review and potential acceptance of your Choice Project.

__Design Requirements__: While the intent of a choice project is to provide flexibility, there are some practicalities involved.  For your plan to be accepted, it must pass the test for desirability, feasibility, and viability.

- Desirability: This is about being human.  Is this something that we need?  Does it address some worthwhile problem or introduce something interesting?  Is it STEM related and provide a chance to develop key skills?

- Feasibility: This is about technology.  Is the project in the realm of the possible?  Can you finish it in the time alloted?

- Viability: This is about business and politics. Is it realistic?  Are there the resources to complete it?  Is it socially questionable?

The following checklist ascribes “point-value” to each of your project proposal elements.  The more questions you can answer “yes” to, the more desirable, viable, and feasible your proposal!

| Criterion  | Yes | No |
|---|---|---|
| Is it technically possible?  |   |   |
| Does it involve Arduino or Raspberry Pi micro-controllers? |   |   |
| Can the project be iterated toward an ideal solution?  |   |   |
| Does it involve collecting, handling, and analyzing data?  |   |   |
| Is there a real “artifact” or finished product that is presented at the end?  |   |   |
| Does it serve some environmental purpose?  |   |   |
| Does it serve some socially responsible aim?  |   |   |
| Is it off-the-hook COOL?  |   |   |
| Does it require fabrication of a physical structure?  |   |   |
| Does it involve level-appropriate coding?  |   |   |
| Does it involve prototyping?  |   |   |
| Can it be done in groups?  |   |   |
| Does it involve testing?  |   |   |
| Does it require research?  |   |   |
| Does it involve using level-appropriate mathematics?  |   |   |
| Does it have a science-based focus?  |   |   |
| Does it have an engineering-based focus?  |   |   |
| Is it “un-Googleable?”  |   |   |
| Is it based in robotics?  |   |   |
| Does it involve some aspect of predictive modeling?  |   |   |

## Project Plan

1.  Project Title:    
2.  Project Summary (100-150 words)    
3.  Describe your personal interest in this project.    
4.  Do you need any extra resources (other than time and access to a computer)?    
5.  Do you have any mentors who can provide additional guidance during the project?     
6.  Projects sometimes don’t work out.   What are potential barriers to success and how do you plan to show your learning in the case that the project idea fails?
