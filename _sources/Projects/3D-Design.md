#### Choice Final Artifact
##### Tinkercad Floorplan of your House
- Tinkercad: see [Tinkercad Floorplan of your House](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19F4BUN1FLyCNFuPFP3ZkJPlq-RJ5m0q25ctKKuxHXmI/edit?usp=sharing) 
- Tinkercad: 1/100th or 1/50th scale floor plan of your house 
- Minimal expectation: a scaled floor plan ([Tinkercad slice that looks like the Revit Extended Plan](https://www.instructables.com/Create-a-Floor-Plan-of-Your-House-1/)) of each level of your house:![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WrtQdj9VQkvPoBtdY_Y3NmuplS5ea6UvK46CxIWxL97lCG2Ov33yBRpucRgbvqo5f0TZimH0lM_-vxm0bQpWHCMefC4iLovJMt_1Z-K3zEd0Jm282Yi17DYdBI1OgeNXCXSdfhCM)

###### General Stuff
- Vancouver “plots” (the chunk of land your house is on; your house and yard) are standardized to, on average, 90’ deep by 33 ⅓’ wide.
- For historical reasons (fires, sidewalks, plumbing service, electrical service), house have to be ‘set-back’ certain distances from the edge of the property, leading to an average house size of about 20’ x 20’
- Walls (considering both interior and exterior) are, on average, 6’’ in thickness
- Floors (ceilings) are, on average, 1’ in thickness
- Doors, hallways are, on average 1 ½ people wide (~3’ or ~900 mm)
- Stairs have an approximate ⅔ rise over run - meaning that if the tread (or step) is a 1’, the runner (or lift) is 8”.  This also means that to rise 8’ to the next level would require 12’ of horizontal stairs (3/2 run over rise or 150%).  In full size mm, this would be 2400 mm (12 * 200 mm) rise to 3600 mm (12 * 300 mm) run
- A “floor” is usually either 9’ or 10’, including the 1’ of the ‘roof’ separating the two ‘floors’ (to say that a room has “8’ ceilings” implies that there is 8’ between lower horizontal surface - the floor -  and upper horizontal surface - the ceiling.  This room would be considered 9’ tall, as it would also include the 1’ of the rafters and finish of the ceiling/floor above)

###### What does this all translate to?
- 6” (six inches) is ~15 cm or 150 mm
- 1’ (one foot) is ~30 cm or 300 mm
- 20’ (twenty feet) is ~ 6.1 m or 6100 mm
- Scale factor of 1/100 would give you:
	- a rough house size of 60 mm
	- wall thickness of 1.5 mm
	- floor thickness of 3 mm
	- hallways and doors of 9 mm
	- stairs with a run over rise of 3 mm/2 mm
- Scale factor of 1/50 would give you:
	- a rough house size of 120 mm
	- wall thickness of 3 mm
	- floor thickness of 6 mm
	- hallways and doors of 18 mm
	- stairs with a run over rise of 6 mm/4 mm

##### Code-based city-blocks
- Code-blocks: see [Code-based city-blocks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SsZHXthlSIbMtIuIE2PVeJuhHZfcue6zwDJMZ9YCjOA/edit?usp=sharing)
- Can you reproduce the following cityscape with codeblocks? 
- Buildings are 20x20 units with random heights and different roofs (by row).  There is a 2 unit separation between neighboring buildings.  Blocks are a 2x4 grid of buildings.  Streets are the same units as buildings.

- See below for sample code to make a row of buildings.

- Extending: Can you use the following code to alternate building types in the same row?  Check it out in action at [https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks/edit?doc=eFib02AeVac](https://www.tinkercad.com/codeblocks/edit?doc=eFib02AeVac)

### Final Artifact: CT and 3D Design
#### Instructions

In the attached PowerPoint, use screen captures from your Tinkercad assignment to demonstrate how you APPLIED the following Computational Thinking practices:
- Decomposition (what was the problem; what smaller pieces did you break it into?)
- Pattern Recognition (what parts is the problem made of; what actions repeat?)
- Abstraction (in what ways did you make one thing that can be used in more than one situation?)
- Algorithms (what "recipes" did you make; what "problems" did they solve?)    

Please attach an image of your design for me to see using the "Add work"  link below.  For:
